# wordpress_app_test
create a GitHub Actions
workflow that builds a Docker image for WordPress using a
multi-stage Docker build. The first stage should prepare the
base operating system image, and the second stage should
install and configure WordPress. The built Docker image
should be pushed to a private Docker Hub repository that
you own.
